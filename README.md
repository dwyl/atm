> *alvo is our* ***Quest*** *is to* ***codify*** *the* ***vocabulary*** *that* ***people***
*use when teaching* ***each other*** *how to* ***interact*** *with the* ***web***.

**alvo** (pronounced "*al vu*!") enables ***non-technical people*** to ***understand*** and ***test*** the **web**.

## Why?


workflow:
+ watchify files in `/lib`
+ browserify files in `/lib`
pre-commit:
+ uglify build.js


### Story

We all have a ***personal story*** of teaching someone how to use the internet.
I have taught *many* people how to use the web (including how to write HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/etc)
but one that stands out as meaningful was in the winter of 2005 when I sat down and taught my (retired-journalist) *father*
how to get online, Search (Goolge) and send/read email. At the time I produced
a *bespoke* 30 page manual with detailed screenshots of each step he would need to perform to accomplish his desired task because I
*knew* he was was going to need to refer back to it after I left to go back to
university [a thousand miles away](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+edinburgh+to+lisbon+as+the+crow+flies).
I did not publish this user manual because it contained passwords and photos of
my dad's actual equipment, but I wish I had kept it for posterity...
Anyway, what if there was a simpler way of doing that?
What if you could record a "Macro"

### Pain Point

As [***Creative Technologist***](https://markavnet.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/what-the-heck-is-a-creative-technologist/)
we *love* speaking to the ***people*** that *use* our products to get their *feedback*.  
Often the people *using* our products are non-technical and thus showing them *code* is *futile*.  
Non-technical people are not "*stupid*"
(many of the "product owners" and "end users" we've worked with are *insanely smart*!),  
they just don't have [***time***](https://github.com/ideaq/time)
to know *everything* (*who does*?!) and thus learning to code (*in addition to their existing workload*)
is *impractical*.

So, we are on a *mission* to simplify web creativity for everyone!

## Features

### Plain English*

We want this to be as *simple* as possible, so we are
building it *from scratch* to look/read like English (*not code*).

A ***simple example*** of submitting a contact form using Liso:

```yml
visit /contact
input #text  "I want to know more about alvo!"
input #email "jenny.macawesome@email.net"
click #submit
```

That's it! it reads like english!

**Q**: *What* are the **#** (*hash*) simbols?  
**A**: They are the id's of the form elements on the *contact* page.  
(hint: *Scroll down* to the ***glossary*** to learn more)

# Why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We needed a **_much_ better way**
of **tracking, viewing and _acting_ on**
**metrics** in our projects.

## Data Driven? üôà

After **20 years** of working 
in Web Application/Site Development,
with more than 100 project teams and organizations
we've noted one alarming fact:

**_Most_ Product Owners don't _check_ Google Analytics** 
and use the **insights** to **_drive_ decisions**. 



If the **_leaders_ aren't data driven**,
_nobody_ `else` in the team will be. 
And ultimately the project/product will fail.
Or if it succeeds, 
it will be _despite_ the leaders. 


# What?

More detail in: https://github.com/dwyl/atm/issues/16



## Name? üèß 

"ATM" stands for "Actionable Timely Metrics" (_this is a ["backronym"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym)). We **really** wanted to give this project a name that is both short, _memorable_ and helps stakeholders _understand_ the importance of analytics data to the organisation!

# Who?

This project aims to both _simplify_ the language/vocabulary around analytics/metrics and create a simple way of tracking _any_ event in _any_ web app. 

If it's not _immediately obvious_ **Why** this project is valuable and **How** it works, 
we have failed. So if you are scratching your head wondering: "_Is this for **me**?_" ... 
**please _help_ us** by describing your situation so we can **_help_ you** realise the _value_ of the data you are sending to Google Analytics and then _ignoring_... 

# How?

+ [ ] Define the basic schema for an Events (Analytics) Table!
+ [ ] Implement it!

# Why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We needed a **_much_ better way**
of **tracking, viewing and _acting_ on**
**metrics** in our projects.

## Data Driven? üôà

After **20 years** of working 
in Web Application/Site Development,
with more than 100 project teams and organizations
we've noted one alarming fact:

**_Most_ Product Owners don't _check_ Google Analytics** 
and use the **insights** to **_drive_ decisions**. 



If the **_leaders_ aren't data driven**,
_nobody_ `else` in the team will be. 
And ultimately the project/product will fail.
Or if it succeeds, 
it will be _despite_ the leaders. 


# What?

More detail in: https://github.com/dwyl/atm/issues/16



## Name? üèß 

"ATM" stands for "Actionable Timely Metrics" (_this is a ["backronym"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym)). We **really** wanted to give this project a name that is both short, _memorable_ and helps stakeholders _understand_ the importance of analytics data to the organisation!

# Who?

This project aims to both _simplify_ the language/vocabulary around analytics/metrics and create a simple way of tracking _any_ event in _any_ web app. 

If it's not _immediately obvious_ **Why** this project is valuable and **How** it works, 
we have failed. So if you are scratching your head wondering: "_Is this for **me**?_" ... 
**please _help_ us** by describing your situation so we can **_help_ you** realise the _value_ of the data you are sending to Google Analytics and then _ignoring_... 

# How?

+ [ ] Define the basic schema for an Events (Analytics) Table!
+ [ ] Implement it!
